# What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to keep track of changes made to their code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 as a replacement for the proprietary BitKeeper tool that he had been using to manage the Linux kernel codebase.

Git is particularly popular among software developers because it provides a powerful set of tools for managing code changes and collaborating with others. With Git, developers can create and merge branches, revert changes, and share code with others through a variety of hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

Git is open-source software, which means that anyone can download and use it for free. It runs on a variety of platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows, and can be integrated with a wide range of software development tools and workflows.

# What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based hosting platform that provides a centralized location for software developers to store, manage, and collaborate on their code. It was created in 2008 and quickly became one of the most popular code hosting platforms in the world.

GitHub is built on top of Git, the distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds. This means that developers can use Git commands to manage their code on GitHub, including creating and merging branches, reverting changes, and sharing code with others.

# What is the difference between Git and Github?

Git and GitHub are often confused with each other, but they are actually two different things. Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code over time, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a centralized location for developers to store and collaborate on their code.
Git provides the underlying version control system, while GitHub provides a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.

# Main commands used in Git:

- git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

- git add: Adds files to the staging area, which prepares them for committing.

- git commit: Saves changes to the repository with a message describing the changes.

- git status: Shows the status of the working directory, including any changes that have been made.

- git log: Shows the commit history of the repository.

- git diff: Shows the differences between the current state of the code and the last commit.

- git branch: Lists all the branches in the repository, or creates a new branch.

- git checkout: Switches between branches or restores files from a previous commit.

- git merge: Combines changes from one branch into another.

- git push: Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.

- git pull: Downloads content from a remote repository and integrates it with the local repository.

# Git  branches

A branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. It is a way to work on different versions of a codebase simultaneously, without affecting the original code.
When a developer creates a branch, Git creates a new pointer to the current commit, which allows them to make changes to the code without affecting the original codebase. This allows developers to experiment with new features or bug fixes without disrupting the main codebase.
Branches are a powerful feature of Git that allow developers to work on code changes in a flexible and collaborative manner, while minimizing the risk of breaking the original codebase.
